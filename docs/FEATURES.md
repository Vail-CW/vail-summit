# Features

This document covers detailed documentation for major features including CW Academy, Morse Shooter, Memory Chain, Radio Mode, and Morse Decoder.

## CW Academy Training Mode

### Overview

The CW Academy mode implements the official CW Academy curriculum across **four training tracks**. Each track is a comprehensive 16-session program with progressive difficulty.

### Training Tracks

1. **Beginner** - Learn CW from zero (4 → 44 characters over Sessions 1-10)
2. **Fundamental** - Build solid foundation (assumes basic CW knowledge)
3. **Intermediate** - Increase speed & skill (higher WPM targets)
4. **Advanced** - Master advanced CW techniques

### Module Architecture: `training_cwa.h`

**Track Structure:**
```cpp
enum CWATrack {
  TRACK_BEGINNER = 0,
  TRACK_FUNDAMENTAL = 1,
  TRACK_INTERMEDIATE = 2,
  TRACK_ADVANCED = 3
};
```

**Session Data Structure:**
```cpp
struct CWASession {
  int sessionNum;           // Session number (1-16)
  int charCount;            // Total characters learned by this session
  const char* newChars;     // New characters introduced
  const char* description;  // Session description
};
```

### Beginner Track Session Progression

**Sessions 1-10:** Progressive character introduction (4 chars → 44 chars)
- Session 1: A, E, N, T (4 chars) - Foundation
- Session 2: + S, I, O, 1, 4 (9 chars) - Numbers Begin
- Session 10: + X, Z, ., <BK>, <SK> (44 chars) - Complete!

**Sessions 11-13:** QSO (conversation) practice with all 44 characters

**Sessions 14-16:** On-air preparation and encouragement

### Practice Types

```cpp
enum CWAPracticeType {
  PRACTICE_COPY = 0,           // Listen and type what you hear
  PRACTICE_SENDING = 1,        // Send with physical key
  PRACTICE_DAILY_DRILL = 2     // Warm-up drills
};
```

**Practice Type Locking:**
- **Sessions 1-10:** Only Copy Practice available (advanced types locked)
- **Sessions 11+:** All practice types unlocked
- Visual lock indicators with "Unlocks at Session 11" hint
- Error beep feedback when attempting to access locked content

### Message Types

```cpp
enum CWAMessageType {
  MESSAGE_CHARACTERS = 0,      // Random character practice
  MESSAGE_WORDS = 1,           // Common words
  MESSAGE_ABBREVIATIONS = 2,   // CW abbreviations (73, QSL, etc.)
  MESSAGE_NUMBERS = 3,         // Number sequences
  MESSAGE_CALLSIGNS = 4,       // Random callsigns
  MESSAGE_PHRASES = 5          // Full sentences
};

## Morse Shooter Game

### Overview

The Morse Shooter is an arcade-style game where targets fall from the top of the screen and the player shoots them by keying morse code (straight key, iambic paddle, or ultimatic). The game uses the user-selected morse decoder (Adaptive or Direct, set in CW Settings) for real-time decoding. UI is fully LVGL (`lv_game_screens.h`); game logic lives in `game_morse_shooter.h`.

### Game Modes

| Mode | Targets | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Classic** | Single characters | Charset from preset, or custom flags (letters / +numbers / +punctuation) |
| **Progressive** | Single characters | Starts with E/T; unlocks more characters, faster falls, and more concurrent targets as levels advance (every 30s or 10 hits) |
| **Word** | Short CW words (CQ, QTH, RST...) | Word list difficulty follows the preset; words fall at 0.6x speed |
| **Callsign** | Randomly generated callsigns | US + 30% international prefixes |

Each mode keeps its own persistent high score.

### Difficulty Presets

Seven presets (Custom, Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert, Insane) control fall speed, spawn rate, lives, max concurrent targets, and charset. Expert/Insane include numbers and punctuation. The Custom preset unlocks the Speed(fall), Lives, and Charset rows. Keying WPM and sidetone are always editable — they are player settings, not difficulty settings.

### Game Loop Architecture

**Dual update system** (both dispatched from `pollTable` every main-loop iteration; the mode is `MODE_FLAG_AUDIO_CRITICAL`, so the loop runs at 1ms):

1. **`updateMorseShooterInput()`** — every iteration: polls paddles, ticks the unified keyer and decoder, flushes the decoder after a word gap of silence.
2. **`updateMorseShooterVisuals()`** — dt-based physics tick every 50ms (speeds are in px/sec). **Frozen while keying**: moving LVGL objects forces display flushes that can crunch live audio, and it gives the player a fair chance to finish the character they started. The tick clock is kept current during the freeze so no teleport-jump happens on unfreeze.

### Shooting

Characters are processed **as soon as they decode** (per-character, at character-gap latency) via the decoder `messageCallback` — not after a word gap. This is what makes Word/Callsign modes playable: every keystroke in a sequence registers.

- **Classic/Progressive**: the matching letter *closest to the ground* is shot.
- **Word/Callsign**: the first matched character "commits" you to a word (prevents callsigns sharing a prefix from stealing keystrokes); a mistype abandons progress and can start another word. Typed prefix renders green via LVGL recolor.
- Prosigns (`<AR>` etc.) are ignored, never treated as targets.
- Miss (decoded char matches nothing): 600 Hz beep, combo resets.

### Scoring

- Base 10 points x combo multiplier (x2 at 3 streak, x3 at 5, x5 at 10, x10 at 20) + speed bonus for hits near the top. Words score x word length.
- High scores update in-memory during play and are committed to NVS **only at game over/exit** — flash commits stall both cores' cache and would crunch live audio if done per hit.

### Spawning

- Letters: random x with 20-attempt collision avoidance (34px horizontal / 40px vertical spacing).
- Words: width-aware placement — the whole word is kept on screen, horizontal overlap with other high words is avoided, and no new word spawns while another is still near the top (prevents same-line overlap).

### Game Over and Restart

- Lives reach 0 (targets hitting the ground each cost one life), or ESC ends the game early to see results.
- Overlay shows final score + NEW HIGH SCORE banner; ENTER restarts (full screen recreation via `startShooterFromSettings()`), ESC exits to the games menu.

## Memory Chain Game

### Overview

Memory Chain is a progressive memory training game that challenges players to remember and reproduce increasingly long sequences of morse code characters. Similar to the classic "Simon Says" game but using CW, it tests both character recognition and short-term memory skills.

### Module: `game_morse_memory.h`

**Game Flow:**
1. Device plays a morse code sequence
2. Player must reproduce the exact sequence using their key
3. On success: sequence grows by one character
4. On failure: game over (Standard mode) or lose a life (Practice mode)

### Game Modes

**Standard Mode:**
- One mistake = game over
- Pure score chase for maximum chain length
- High pressure, tests focus and accuracy

**Practice Mode:**
- 3 lives/hearts per game
- Mistakes cost one life but game continues
- Allows recovery and continued practice
- Better for learning and improvement

**Timed Challenge:**
- Complete as many rounds as possible in 60 seconds
- No game over on mistakes
- Score = total successful chains completed

### Difficulty Levels

**Beginner:**
- Letters only (A-Z)
- 26 character pool
- Ideal for character recognition practice

**Intermediate:**
- Letters + Numbers (A-Z, 0-9)
- 36 character pool
- Increased complexity

**Advanced:**
- Letters + Numbers + Prosigns
- Includes: SK, AR, BT, BK, AS, SN, SOS, HH, CT
- Full morse code challenge

### Settings

**Speed:** 5-40 WPM (adjustable in 5 WPM increments)
**Sound:** ON/OFF (controls sequence playback audio)
**Show Hints:** ON/OFF (default OFF)
- OFF: True memory training - no visual hints
- ON: Display character sequence on screen for reference

All settings persist across power cycles via ESP32 Preferences.

### Keyer Support

Full integration with existing CW settings:
- **Straight Key Mode:** Uses DIT pin only
- **Iambic A/B Mode:** Full paddle squeeze support
- Uses same keyer implementation as Practice Mode and Morse Shooter
- Respects global key type setting from CW Settings menu

### Decoder Integration

**Real-time decoder (Adaptive or Direct based on user setting):**
```cpp
MorseDecoder* mcDecoder = (decoderType == DECODER_DIRECT)
    ? (MorseDecoder*) new MorseDecoderDirect(15, 20, 30)
    : (MorseDecoder*) new MorseDecoderAdaptive(15, 20, 30);
```

**Character Detection:**
- Automatic character gap detection (5× dit duration)
- Decoder flush after character gap for immediate recognition
- Callback-based character processing
- Immediate feedback on correct/incorrect input

**Timing States:**
- Tracks tone-on/tone-off transitions
- Sends positive timing for tone duration
- Sends negative timing for silence duration
- Decoder adapts to player's sending speed

### Visual Feedback

**Game States:**
- **READY:** Green - Game starting (1 second countdown)
- **LISTEN:** Blue - Device playing sequence
- **YOUR TURN:** Yellow/Orange - Awaiting player input
- **CORRECT!:** Green - Successful sequence reproduction
- **WRONG!:** Red - Incorrect character sent

**Display Elements:**
- Chain length (top right): "Chain: X"
- Current score and all-time best (bottom)
- Lives remaining (Practice mode only)
- Optional character hints (if enabled)
- Instructions: "ESC=Menu  S=Settings"

### Audio Feedback

**Success Sounds:**
- Correct answer: High beep (1000 Hz, 200ms)
- New high score: Victory fanfare (3 ascending tones)

**Error Sounds:**
- Wrong answer: Low buzz (200 Hz, 300ms)

**Sidetone:**
- Always plays during keying (regardless of Sound setting)
- Uses global CW tone setting
- Provides immediate audio feedback

### Data Persistence

**Saved Settings (ESP32 Preferences "memory" namespace):**
- Difficulty level
- Game mode
- WPM speed
- Sound enabled/disabled
- Show hints enabled/disabled
- All-time high score

**High Score Tracking:**
- Session high score (resets on game start)
- All-time best (persists across power cycles)
- Separate high scores per difficulty level (future enhancement)

### State Machine

```cpp
enum MemoryGameState {
  MEMORY_STATE_READY,      // Countdown before first round
  MEMORY_STATE_PLAYING,    // Device playing sequence
  MEMORY_STATE_LISTENING,  // Player's turn to reproduce
  MEMORY_STATE_FEEDBACK,   // Show correct/wrong feedback
  MEMORY_STATE_GAME_OVER   // Final score display
};
```

**State Transitions:**
1. READY → PLAYING (after 1 second)
2. PLAYING → LISTENING (after sequence playback)
3. LISTENING → FEEDBACK (on complete sequence or error)
4. FEEDBACK → LISTENING (correct, next round) or GAME_OVER (out of lives)
5. GAME_OVER → READY (ENTER to play again)

### In-Game Menu (Press 'S')

Navigate settings without exiting the game:
- Up/Down arrows: Navigate menu
- Left/Right arrows: Change values
- Enter: Save & Return

Allows quick adjustment of difficulty, mode, speed, and hints during practice sessions.

### Technical Implementation

**Character Pool Management:**
```cpp
const char* getMemoryCharacterSet(MemoryDifficulty difficulty);
```
Returns appropriate character set based on difficulty.

**Sequence Generation:**
```cpp
void startNextRound() {
  memoryGame.sequenceLength++;
  char newChar = characterSet[random(0, setSize)];
  memoryGame.sequence[memoryGame.sequenceLength - 1] = newChar;
}
```
Adds one random character each round.

**Input Validation:**
```cpp
bool checkPlayerSequence(char inputChar) {
  char expected = memoryGame.sequence[memoryGame.playerPosition];
  bool correct = (inputChar == expected);
  memoryGame.playerPosition++;
  return correct;
}
```
Validates each character as it's decoded.

### Menu Integration

**Location:** Games Menu → Memory Chain
**Menu Icon:** "C" (for Chain)
**Menu Navigation:** Same as other game modes

Access from main menu via right arrow on "Memory Chain" card.

## Radio Mode

### Overview

The Radio Mode provides integration with external ham radios via 3.5mm jack outputs. It allows keying a connected radio using the Summit's paddle inputs with two distinct operating modes.

### Architecture: `radio_output.h`

**Radio Mode Types:**
```cpp
enum RadioMode {
  RADIO_MODE_SUMMIT_KEYER,   // Summit does keying logic, outputs straight key format
  RADIO_MODE_RADIO_KEYER     // Passthrough dit/dah contacts to radio's internal keyer
};
```

**Output Pins:**
- **DIT output:** GPIO 18 (A0) - `RADIO_KEY_DIT_PIN`
- **DAH output:** GPIO 17 (A1) - `RADIO_KEY_DAH_PIN`
- **Format:** 3.5mm TRS jack (Tip = Dit, Ring = Dah, Sleeve = GND)
- **Logic:** Active HIGH (pin goes HIGH when keying)

### Summit Keyer Mode

Device performs all keying logic internally and outputs a straight key format signal:

**Straight Key:**
- DIT pin outputs key-down/key-up timing
- DAH pin remains LOW
- Timing follows physical paddle presses directly

**Iambic (A or B):**
- Summit's iambic keyer generates dit/dah elements with proper timing
- DIT pin outputs composite keyed signal (straight key format)
- DAH pin remains LOW
- Timing based on configured WPM speed (`cwSpeed`)
- Full memory paddle support (squeeze keying)

**No Audio Output:**
- Radio output mode does not play sidetone through Summit's speaker
- External radio provides sidetone

### Radio Keyer Mode

Device passes paddle contacts directly to the radio:

**Straight Key:**
- DIT pin mirrors DIT paddle state (HIGH when pressed)
- DAH pin remains LOW

**Iambic:**
- DIT pin mirrors DIT paddle state
- DAH pin mirrors DAH paddle state
- Radio's internal keyer interprets squeeze keying and timing
- Radio's WPM setting controls speed (Summit's WPM ignored)

### Radio Output UI

The Radio Output screen displays three configurable settings:

1. **Speed (WPM):** 5-40 WPM
   - Only affects Summit Keyer mode
   - Ignored in Radio Keyer mode (radio controls speed)
   - Shares global `cwSpeed` setting with Practice mode

2. **Key Type:** Straight / Iambic A / Iambic B
   - Determines paddle input interpretation
   - Affects both modes
   - Shares global `cwKeyType` setting

3. **Radio Mode:** Summit Keyer / Radio Keyer
   - Toggles between internal and external keying logic
   - Persisted in Preferences namespace "radio"

**Navigation:**
- UP/DOWN: Select setting
- LEFT/RIGHT: Adjust value
- ESC: Exit to Radio menu

### Input Sources

Radio Output accepts input from multiple sources simultaneously (OR logic):

1. **Physical Paddle** (GPIO 6 for DIT, GPIO 9 for DAH)
2. **Capacitive Touch** (GPIO 8 for DIT, GPIO 5 for DAH)

Both checked every loop iteration for responsive keying.

### Use Cases

**Contest Operation:**
- Summit Keyer mode for consistent sending at configured speed
- Memory messages for exchanges (future feature)
- Physical paddle for flexibility

**Casual QSOs:**
- Radio Keyer mode to use radio's built-in keyer settings
- Capacitive touch pads for portable operation
- Radio provides sidetone and QSK

**Training Aid:**
- Practice sending at various speeds
- Compare Summit Keyer vs. Radio Keyer behavior
- Use with actual radio for on-air confidence

### CW Memories

The **CW Memories** feature allows storage and management of up to 10 reusable morse code message presets. Presets can be created, edited, deleted, and previewed on the device, or managed via the web interface. They integrate seamlessly with Radio Output mode for transmission.

#### Architecture: `radio_cw_memories.h`

**Preset Structure:**
```cpp
#define CW_MEMORY_MAX_SLOTS 10
#define CW_MEMORY_LABEL_MAX_LENGTH 15
#define CW_MEMORY_MESSAGE_MAX_LENGTH 100

struct CWMemoryPreset {
  char label[CW_MEMORY_LABEL_MAX_LENGTH + 1];     // Label (15 chars + null)
  char message[CW_MEMORY_MESSAGE_MAX_LENGTH + 1]; // Message (100 chars + null)
  bool isEmpty;
};
```

**Storage:**
- Persistent storage via ESP32 Preferences namespace `"cw_memories"`
- Keys: `"label1"` through `"label10"`, `"message1"` through `"message10"`
- Loaded at startup via `loadCWMemories()`
- Saved immediately on create/edit/delete

#### Device UI - CW Memories Mode

Accessible from: **Radio Menu → CW Memories**

**Main Screen:**
- Scrollable list of all 10 preset slots (5 visible at a time)
- Shows `[Slot #] Label` or `[Slot #] (empty)` for unused slots
- Navigation: UP/DOWN to select, ENTER to open action menu, ESC to exit
- Footer: `↑↓ Select  ENTER Menu  ESC Back`

**Action Menu (Full-Screen):**
When ENTER is pressed on a slot, a full-screen action menu appears:

**Empty Slot Actions:**
- **Create Preset** - Opens label entry screen
- **Cancel** - Returns to main list

**Occupied Slot Actions:**
- **Preview** - Plays preset on device speaker
- **Edit Preset** - Opens label/message editor
- **Delete Preset** - Shows delete confirmation
- **Cancel** - Returns to main list

Navigation: UP/DOWN to select action, ENTER to confirm, ESC to cancel

**Create/Edit Flow (Full-Screen):**
1. **Label Entry Screen:**
   - Title: "CREATE PRESET" or "EDIT PRESET"
   - Input box with character counter (max 15 chars)
   - Auto-uppercase text entry
   - Blinking cursor indicator
   - Footer: `Type text  ENTER Save  ESC Cancel`

2. **Message Entry Screen:**
   - Title: "CREATE PRESET" or "EDIT PRESET"
   - Multi-line input box with word wrap (max 100 chars)
   - Character counter showing current/max
   - Validation for valid morse characters (A-Z, 0-9, space, `.`,`,`,`?`,`/`,`-`)
   - Supports prosigns entered as `<AR>`, `<SK>`, etc.
   - Footer: `Type text  ENTER Save  ESC Cancel`

3. **Save:** ENTER advances from label → message → save, ESC cancels at any time

**Delete Confirmation (Full-Screen):**
- Title: "DELETE PRESET?" in red
- Shows preset label being deleted
- Warning: "This action cannot be undone"
- Two large buttons: **Yes, Delete** (red highlight) and **No, Cancel** (blue highlight)
- Navigation: UP/DOWN arrows to select, ENTER to confirm
- Footer: `↑↓ Select  ENTER Confirm  ESC Cancel`

**Preview:**
- Plays preset message on device speaker using current WPM and tone settings
- Does NOT transmit via radio output pins (GPIO 18/17 remain LOW)
- Press ESC to stop playback early

#### Radio Output Mode Integration

In Radio Output mode, press the **'M'** key to open the memory selector:

**Memory Selector Overlay:**
- Modal overlay showing all 10 preset slots
- Scrollable list (5 visible at a time)
- Shows slot number and label (or "(empty)")
- Navigation: UP/DOWN to select, ENTER to queue for transmission, ESC to cancel

**Transmission:**
- Selected preset message is queued via existing `queueRadioMessage()` function
- Uses current WPM speed and Radio Mode settings
- Transmitted via radio output pins (GPIO 18/17)
- Queue limit: 5 messages (error beep if full)

**UI Indicator:**
- Footer in Radio Output mode shows: `M Memories` as hint

#### Debugging and Troubleshooting

**Debug Logging:**
The CW Memories module includes comprehensive debug output via Serial (115200 baud) for troubleshooting:

- `loadCWMemories()` - Prints each slot's label and message when loading from Preferences
- `saveCWMemory()` - Prints label and message when saving to Preferences
- `previewCWMemory()` - Prints label, message, and length before playback
- `queueRadioMessage()` - Prints message and length when queuing for transmission
- `processRadioMessageQueue()` - Prints message and length when transmitting via radio
- `radioIambicKeyerHandler()` - Prints dit/dah duration values for timing verification

**Known Issues:**

1. **Summit Keyer Mode Timing:**
   - In Summit Keyer mode, if `radioDitDuration` becomes corrupted or zero, both manual keying and memory transmission produce "random dits" (rapid/instant timing)
   - Radio Keyer mode works correctly for manual keying (passthrough to radio's keyer)
   - Memories may still sound incorrect in Radio Keyer mode if message queue conflicts with keyer state machine

2. **State Machine Conflict:**
   - `playMorseCharViaRadio()` uses blocking delays while `updateRadioOutput()` keyer state machine runs simultaneously
   - Both functions control the same GPIO pins (18 and 17), causing interference
   - Current mitigation: `processRadioMessageQueue()` waits for keyer state machine to be idle in Summit Keyer mode (checks `radioKeyerActive` and `radioInSpacing` flags)

3. **Preview Crashes:**
   - Preview function (`previewCWMemory()`) may crash and reset device halfway through playback
   - Likely related to blocking audio playback conflicting with other system tasks
   - Workaround: Keep preview messages short or use radio transmission instead

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. Enable Serial Monitor at 115200 baud
2. Create a simple test memory (e.g., "TEST" → "SOS")
3. Preview the memory and check serial output for:
   - Correct label and message strings
   - Correct message length
   - Dit/dah duration values (should be non-zero and proportional to WPM)
4. Compare behavior between Summit Keyer and Radio Keyer modes
5. Check if manual keying works correctly in both modes (isolates keyer vs. message queue issues)

#### Supported Characters

**Valid Characters:**
- Letters: A-Z (auto-uppercased)
- Numbers: 0-9
- Punctuation: `.` `,` `?` `/` `-`
- Prosigns: Entered as text like `<AR>`, `<SK>`, `<BK>`, `<BT>`, `<CT>`, `<HH>`, `<SN>`, `<SOS>`
- Spaces: Word spacing in morse code

**Validation:**
- Label and message cannot be empty
- Message must contain only valid morse characters
- Invalid characters trigger error beep and validation message

#### Use Cases

**Contest Operation:**
- Store common exchanges: `"5NN CA"`, `"TU K6ABC"`, `"CQ CQ DE K6ABC K"`
- Quick send via 'M' key in Radio Output mode
- Consistent, error-free messaging

**Casual Operation:**
- Store callsign, standard sign-offs: `"73 ES CUL <SK>"`
- CQ calls with proper prosigns
- Frequently used phrases

**Training:**
- Pre-configured examples for learning proper formats
- Practice sending stored messages

#### State Variables

```cpp
CWMemoryPreset cwMemories[CW_MEMORY_MAX_SLOTS];  // Global array of presets
int cwMemorySelection;                            // Currently selected slot in UI
CWMemoryContextMenu contextMenuActive;            // Current context menu state
CWMemoryEditMode editMode;                        // Current edit mode state
bool memorySelectorActive;                        // True when selector active in Radio Output
int memorySelectorSelection;                      // Selected slot in Radio Output selector
```

## Hear It Type It Training Mode

### Overview

Hear It Type It is a morse code receive training mode that plays random character groups (callsigns, letters, numbers, or custom sets) and challenges users to type what they hear. Available both on-device and via the web interface.

### Module: `training_hear_it_type_it.h`

**Training Workflow:**
1. Device/browser plays a morse code character group
2. User types what they heard
3. System provides instant feedback (correct/incorrect)
4. On success: new group plays
5. On error: same group replays for practice

### Training Modes

**Five Training Modes:**
```cpp
enum HearItMode {
  MODE_CALLSIGNS,        // Realistic ham radio callsigns (W1ABC format)
  MODE_RANDOM_LETTERS,   // Random letters A-Z only
  MODE_RANDOM_NUMBERS,   // Random numbers 0-9 only
  MODE_LETTERS_NUMBERS,  // Mixed letters and numbers
  MODE_CUSTOM_CHARS      // User-specified character set
};
```

**Mode Details:**

1. **Callsigns Mode (Default)**
   - Generates realistic amateur radio callsigns
   - Format follows FCC call patterns: 1-2 prefix letters + number + 1-4 suffix letters
   - Examples: W1ABC, K6XYZ, VE3ABC, N7MNO
   - Prepares users for on-air copy work

2. **Random Letters**
   - Pure alphabet practice (A-Z)
   - Variable length groups (3-10 characters)
   - Tests letter recognition skills

3. **Random Numbers**
   - Number-only practice (0-9)
   - Variable length groups (3-10 characters)
   - Useful for contest exchanges and signal reports

4. **Letters + Numbers**
   - Mixed alphanumeric groups
   - Variable length (3-10 characters)
   - Full character set practice

5. **Custom Characters**
   - User specifies exact character set
   - Can practice specific problem characters
   - Examples: "ETI" (common letters), "QZ" (difficult letters), "0189" (similar numbers)
   - Groups randomly selected from custom set

### Settings

**Group Length:** 3-10 characters (adjustable)
- Callsigns mode: Fixed length based on callsign format (5-7 characters typical)
- All other modes: User-configurable length

**Custom Character Set:** (Custom mode only)
- Specify exact characters to practice
- Max 36 characters (A-Z, 0-9)
- Must contain at least 1 character
- Groups randomly generated from this set

**Speed:** Uses global CW speed setting (5-40 WPM)

**Persistence:** Settings stored in ESP32 Preferences namespace `"hear_it"` with keys:
- `"mode"` - Selected training mode (0-4)
- `"groupLength"` - Character count (3-10)
- `"customChars"` - Custom character string

### Web Interface Implementation

**Access:** `http://vail-summit.local/hear-it`

**Files:**
- `web_pages_hear_it_type_it.h` - Complete HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface
- `web_hear_it_mode.h` - Device-side mode handler
- `web_hear_it_socket.h` - WebSocket communication handler

**Architecture:**

```
Browser (Computer)
├── Settings Panel (Mode, Length, Custom Chars)
├── Audio Playback (Web Audio API - browser plays morse)
├── Input Field (Type what you hear)
└── WebSocket Client (Submit answers, receive results)
        ↕ WebSocket (/ws/hear-it)
VAIL SUMMIT Device
├── Character Generation (generateCharacterGroup)
├── Answer Validation (check correctness)
└── Device Display (Static "Web Hear It Mode Active")
```

**Key Design Decision - Browser Audio:**
- Audio playback handled entirely in browser using Web Audio API
- Device sends morse pattern (e.g., ".- -... -.-.") via WebSocket
- Browser plays morse tones using OscillatorNode with PARIS timing
- Prevents device crashes from audio conflicts
- Provides cleaner, more reliable audio playback

**Settings Panel:**
- **Mode Dropdown:** Callsigns, Random Letters, Random Numbers, Letters+Numbers, Custom
- **Length Input:** Number selector (3-10), hidden for Callsigns mode
- **Custom Characters Input:** Text field, visible only in Custom mode
- Settings sent to device via POST before starting training
- Device applies settings and generates groups accordingly

**Training Flow:**
1. User opens `/hear-it` in browser
2. Selects mode, length, custom characters
3. Clicks "Start Training"
   - Browser sends POST `/api/hear-it/start` with settings
   - Device applies settings to `hearItSettings` struct
   - Device switches to `MODE_WEB_HEAR_IT`
   - Browser opens WebSocket to `/ws/hear-it`
4. Device generates character group using selected mode
5. Device sends morse pattern to browser via WebSocket
6. Browser plays morse code audio using Web Audio API
7. Browser shows input field when audio completes
8. User types answer and submits
9. Browser sends answer to device
10. Device validates and sends result (correct/incorrect)
11. On correct: device generates new group after 2s delay
12. On incorrect: device replays same group after 2s delay
13. User can click "Replay" or "Skip" buttons at any time

**WebSocket Protocol:**

**Device → Browser Messages:**
```json
// New character group
{
  "type": "new_callsign",
  "callsign": "W1ABC",
  "wpm": 18,
  "morse": ".- -.-- .---- .- -... -.-."
}

// Start audio playback
{
  "type": "playing"
}

// Ready for user input
{
  "type": "ready_for_input"
}

// Validation result
{
  "type": "result",
  "correct": true,
  "answer": "W1ABC"
}
```

**Browser → Device Messages:**
```json
// Submit answer
{
  "type": "submit",
  "answer": "W1ABC"
}

// Replay request
{
  "type": "replay"
}

// Skip to next
{
  "type": "skip"
}
```

**Audio Implementation (Web Audio API):**
```javascript
async function playMorsePattern(patterns, wpm) {
  const audioContext = new AudioContext();
  const ditDuration = 1200 / wpm;  // PARIS standard

  for (const pattern of patterns.split(' ')) {
    for (const symbol of pattern) {
      if (symbol === '.') {
        playTone(audioContext, 700, ditDuration);
      } else if (symbol === '-') {
        playTone(audioContext, 700, ditDuration * 3);
      }
      await sleep(ditDuration);  // Inter-element gap
    }
    await sleep(ditDuration * 3);  // Letter gap
  }
}

function playTone(context, frequency, duration) {
  const oscillator = context.createOscillator();
  const gainNode = context.createGain();

  oscillator.frequency.value = frequency;
  gainNode.gain.value = 0.3;  // Constant volume (matches Memory Chain)

  oscillator.connect(gainNode);
  gainNode.connect(context.destination);
  oscillator.start(context.currentTime);
  oscillator.stop(context.currentTime + duration / 1000);
}
```

**State Management:**
```javascript
let ws = null;
let currentTrainingState = 'idle';  // idle, playing, waiting_input, replay, skip
let currentCallsign = '';
let currentWPM = 0;
```

### API Endpoints

**`POST /api/hear-it/start`**
- Starts web-based Hear It Type It mode
- Body: `{"mode": 0-4, "length": 3-10, "customChars": "ABC..."}`
- Device applies settings to `hearItSettings` struct
- Switches device to `MODE_WEB_HEAR_IT`
- Returns: `{"status": "active", "endpoint": "ws://vail-summit.local/ws/hear-it"}`

**WebSocket: `/ws/hear-it`**
- Bidirectional communication for training session
- Device sends morse patterns and validation results
- Browser sends answers and control commands (replay/skip)

### Character Generation Algorithm

**Callsigns Mode:**
```cpp
String generateCharacterGroup() {
  String prefix = randomPrefix();         // 1-2 letters (e.g., "W", "K", "VE")
  String number = String(random(0, 10));  // 0-9
  String suffix = randomSuffix();         // 1-4 letters
  return prefix + number + suffix;        // e.g., "W1ABC"
}
```

**Other Modes:**
```cpp
String generateCharacterGroup() {
  String pool = getCharacterPool();  // Based on mode setting
  String group = "";
  for (int i = 0; i < hearItSettings.groupLength; i++) {
    group += pool[random(0, pool.length())];
  }
  return group;
}
```

**Character Pools:**
- Random Letters: `"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"`
- Random Numbers: `"0123456789"`
- Letters+Numbers: `"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"`
- Custom: `hearItSettings.customChars`

## Morse Code Decoder

### Overview

The morse decoder provides real-time decoding of paddle/key input. Two decoder algorithms are bundled and runtime-selectable from CW Settings ("Decoder Type"):

- **Adaptive** — adapts WPM estimate from incoming timings using a weighted moving average. Best when the operator's speed varies or for decoding incoming morse from another op (Vail Repeater Decoder room).
- **Direct** — timer-driven, fixed-WPM. Faster character flush at the cost of not auto-adjusting to speed drift. Best when the operator keys at a known consistent WPM.

The selected decoder is used everywhere morse needs to be decoded on-device: Practice, CW Academy, LICW, Vail Master, Memory Chain, Morse Shooter, CW Speeder, Morse Notes, web Practice/Memory, and the Vail Repeater Decoder room.

Based on the open-source [morse-pro](https://github.com/scp93ch/morse-pro) JavaScript library by Stephen C Phillips, ported to C++ for ESP32.

### Architecture: Four-Module Design

**Module Structure:**
- **`morse_wpm.h`** - WPM timing utilities (PARIS standard formulas)
- **`morse_decoder.h`** - Base decoder class (timings → morse patterns → text), virtual methods for `addTiming` / `reset` / `tick`
- **`morse_decoder_adaptive.h`** - Adaptive speed tracking with weighted averaging
- **`morse_decoder_direct.h`** - Timer-driven flush at fixed WPM (subclass of `MorseDecoderAdaptive` for the timing classification, but overrides flush behavior)

The base class is virtual so callers can hold a `MorseDecoder*` and let the concrete class be selected at runtime via `decoderType` (defined in `src/settings/settings_decoder.h`).

### How It Works

**Input Format:**
- Decoder accepts timing values in milliseconds
- **Positive values** = tone ON (dit or dah)
- **Negative values** = silence (element gap, character gap, word gap)

**Adaptive Speed Algorithm:**

Every decoded element provides speed information:
- Dit → duration = 1 dit
- Dah → duration = 3 dits
- Character gap → duration = 3 fdits (Farnsworth)

The decoder maintains a circular buffer of the last 30 timing samples and uses **weighted averaging** (newer samples weighted more heavily: 1, 2, 3, ..., 30) to continuously refine its WPM estimate.

**Classification Thresholds:**
- Dit/Dah boundary: 2 × dit length
- Dah/Space boundary: 5 × Farnsworth dit length
- Noise threshold: 10ms (filters glitches)
- **Word gap stability:** fditLen locked to ditLen for consistent word detection (prevents threshold drift)

### Integration with Practice Mode

**Real-Time Decoding:**
- Enabled by default in practice mode
- Press 'D' key to toggle display on/off
- Modern card-style UI with three info panels:
  - **SET WPM** (cyan badge): Configured speed
  - **ACTUAL** (green badge): Detected WPM with color coding (green = matches, yellow = different)
  - **KEY TYPE** (yellow badge): Straight/Iambic A/Iambic B
- Decoder display shows 2 lines of decoded text (17 chars per line, size 3 font)
- Supports 9 prosigns: AR, AS, BK, BT, CT, HH, SK, SN, SOS (displayed as `<AR>`, etc.)
- Hovering colored badges for visual hierarchy
- Arrow keys adjust speed (up/down) and key type (left/right)

**Timing Capture:**
- **Straight Key:** Measures tone-on and silence durations directly
- **Iambic:** Uses element start/stop times from iambic state machine
- Feeds timings to decoder after each element completes
- **First-run initialization:** `lastStateChangeTime` set to 0 to prevent spurious decoding on first entry
- Only calculates durations after first valid key press

**UI Update Strategy:**
- Decoder callback sets `needsUIUpdate = true`
- Main loop checks flag after `updatePracticeOscillator()`
- **Only updates when tone is NOT playing** to avoid audio glitches
- Calls `drawDecodedTextOnly()` for partial screen update
- Full redraw avoided during practice for best audio performance

**Auto-Flush Logic:**
- Character boundary detection: 2.5 dits of silence triggers automatic flush (in `addTiming()`)
- Backup timeout: Word gap duration (7 dits) for mid-character abandonment (in `updatePracticeOscillator()`)
- Prevents premature character splitting due to timing jitter
- Ensures real-time character display without waiting for next element
- Character overflow protection: Auto-clears after 34 characters (17 chars × 2 lines)

### Performance

**Memory Footprint:**
- `MorseDecoderAdaptive` instance: ~1-2 KB
- Decoded text buffers (200 chars): ~200 bytes
- Timing buffers (30 samples × 2): ~240 bytes
- **Total: ~2.5 KB** (negligible on ESP32-S3)

**CPU Usage:**
- Decoder processing: <1ms per character
- No floating-point intensive operations
- Real-time suitable for ESP32 at 240 MHz

### Licensing

The morse decoder modules are licensed under **EUPL v1.2** (European Union Public Licence):

- Original code: Copyright (c) 2024 Stephen C Phillips
- ESP32 port: Copyright (c) 2025 VAIL SUMMIT Contributors
- **Weak copyleft** - can be used in proprietary firmware
- **Must keep decoder modules open source** if modified
- Compatible with GPL, LGPL, MPL

Main VAIL SUMMIT firmware can remain under any license. Only the four decoder modules (`morse_wpm.h`, `morse_decoder.h`, `morse_decoder_adaptive.h`, `morse_decoder_direct.h`) are EUPL-licensed.

### Future Applications

The decoder is designed as a reusable component for:

1. **Receive training** - Decode audio from I2S microphone (requires tone detection)
2. **Accuracy metrics** - Compare intended vs. decoded patterns
3. **Contest logging** - Real-time callsign/exchange capture

(CW Academy validation and Vail Repeater Decoder-room decoding are already shipping as of v0.527+.)
